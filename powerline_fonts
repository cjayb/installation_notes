# Mac

* First I cloned the lokaltog-versions of powerline patched fonts here

```
https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts
```

* Then drag-drop the otf-files in to Font Book, but still not visible in terminal (iTerm2). They are placed in ~/Library/Fonts

(Not sure fontconfig is needed, perhaps setting correct in MacVim preferences is enough!)

* install fontconfig with homebrew
* make a link to ~/Library/Fonts: ~/.fonts
* do a font cache refresh (?)

```
fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
```

* to the the fonts OK into MacVim, Preferences->Profile->Text && select Sauce code for both regular and esp. non-ascii text
